Release of UNITE/INSDC representative/reference sequences for use in reference-based chimera detection of fungal ITS sequences in UCHIME and similar programs.

The file "uchime_sh_refs_dynamic_original_985_11.03.2015.fasta" is meant for chimera detection of more or less full-length ITS sequences and is designed to suit the needs of the average user and the kind of ITS datasets typically used in fungal systematics. The sequences were trimmed to remove any larger chunks of SSU/LSU as applicable.

We recognize that users may want to modify the file to suit particular needs. Indeed, the chimera detection process is likely to work better the closer the reference sequences are to the query sequences in terms of length and sequence coverage. Users wanting to keep, say, 30 base-pairs of the SSU/LSU in the sequences are referred to the "--anchor" option of ITSx and the sequence file in the "untrimmed_ITS_sequences" folder in this archive to tailor such datasets. Similarly, the ITSx option "--partial" used in conjunction with the "untrimmed_ITS_sequences" file can be used to output only ITS sequences that are truly full-length.

The folder "ITS1_ITS2_datasets" contains ITS1-only and ITS2-only versions of the reference dataset; these files are recommended over the "*original*" file for chimera detection in amplicon-based ITS1 or ITS2 datasets. The following command was used to generate the ITS1/ITS2 files: perl ITSx -i uchime_sh_refs_dynamic_develop_985_11.03.2015.fasta -o uchime_sh_refs_dynamic_develop_985_11.03.2015 -t F --complement F --cpu 2 --anchor 15 --preserve T
